## Pointers, Arrays, and Strings
### Requirements
Language: C
OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Style guidelines: [Betty style] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

### What to learn 
pointers and how to use them
arrays and how to use them
differences between pointers and arrays
how to use strings and how to manipulate them
scope of variables
### Functions of each file 
1. a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value of the int to 98
2. a function that swaps the values of two integers
3. a function that returns the length of a string
4. a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout
5. a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line
6. a function that reverses a string
7. a function that prints one char out of 2 of a string, followed by a new line
8. a function that prints half of a string, and (length_of_string - 1) / 2 if odd length
9. a function that prints n elements of an array of integers
10. a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest
11. a function that converts a string to an integer -the number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters -need to take into account all the - and + signs before the number -if there are no numbers in the string, the function must return 0 -not allowed to use long -not allowed to declare new variables of “type” array -not allowed to hard-code special values -code needs to work on both ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS -code will be compiled with -fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow gcc flag (You can install the last version on your VM) -code will be compiled with gcc version 5 or above
