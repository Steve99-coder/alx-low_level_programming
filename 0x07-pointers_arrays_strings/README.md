### Requirements
Language: C89
OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Compiler: gcc 11.2.0
Style guidelines: [Betty style] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

### Concepts
What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings
### Description of each file
0. a function that fills memory with a constant byte (memset)
1. a function that copies memory area (memcpy)
2. a function that locates a character in a string (strchr)
3. a function that gets the length of a prefix substring (strspn)
4. a function that searches and returns a pointer to a byte matched in a string (strpbrk)
5. a function that locates a substring (strstr)
6. a function that prints the chessboard
7. a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers
8. a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char
9. a file that contains the password for the [crackme2 executable] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x06.c)
* file should contain the exact password, no new line, no extra space
* ltrace, ldd, gdb and objdump can help
* install the openssl library to run the crackme2 program: sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
