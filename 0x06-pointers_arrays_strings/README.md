## More pointers, arrays, and strings
### Requirements
Language used C
OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Compiler: gcc 11.2.0
Style guidelines: Betty style
 
### Concepts to be learned in this repository:
pointers
arrays
strings

###Description of what each file does:
1. function that concatenates two strings
2. function that returns and concatenates n bytes of another string
3. function that returns and copies n bytes of a string and fills '\0' till end of n bytes
4. function that compares two strings and returns a number re distance of values
5. function that reverses the content of an array of integers
6. function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase
7. function that capitalizes first letter of all words of a string
8. function that encodes a string into 1337 (leet)
9. function that encodes a string using rot13
10. function that prints an integer
* modify set code so program prints a[2] = 98 under certain constraints
* not allowed to use the variable a in your new line of code
* not allowed to modify the variable p
* not allowed to use ,
* not allowed to code anything else than the line of expected line of code at the expected line
* code should be written at line 19, before the ;
* donâ€™t change anything but the line of code you are adding
11. function that adds two numbers
12. function that prints a buffer. - must print the content of size bytes of the buffer pointed by b - output should print 10 bytes per line - each line starts with the position of the first byte of the line in hexadecimal (8 chars), starting with 0 - each line shows the hexadecimal content (2 chars) of the buffer, 2 bytes at a time, separated by a space - each line shows the content of the buffer. If the byte is a printable character, print the letter, if not, print . - each line ends with a new line \n - if size is 0 or less, the output should be a new line only \n
